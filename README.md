# Week 2 (5/26/25 - 6/1/25)

During Week 2, I formalized my project into a project proposal and did some preliminary analysis of the tree geographic data that my project will be built upon.

This week I plan to continue the data analysis. Part of the preliminary step is a proof of concept for calculating allergen density given the various toggles that will be available to the user. Additionally, the data will need a bit of light cleaning to remove missing or irrelevant values. Just getting a feel for how the fields work though will be important for efficiently implementing what I need.

There are no blocks at this time. Right now I am working with an extract of the data inside a JuPyter notebook, so no new tools to learn or anything (yet).

To improve the process over last week, I think organizing things in GitHub will be helpful going forward to have everything in one place and clearly laid out.


# Week 1 (5/19/25 - 5/25/25)

During Week 1, I familiarized myself with the course structure, got my bearings on GitHub pages, and started scoping out my project plans. 

I don't want to overshoot the project parameters by setting goals that are too ambitious nor undershoot and end up completing it too soon. To account for this, I plan to structure my project as a minimal viable product followed by incremental feature additions. 
This way the core of the project will definitely be completed by the end of the course, but there will still be room to keep working if there are still weeks remaining at the end.

So far, the main impediment is just ironing out the project plan (which I plan do to this week) and learning the different tools/technologies necessary to pull it all together.
I am taking two courses this semester, and my usual practice in this situation is to finish the coursework for each in sequence, but going forward I think it will make more sense to work on portions of each so that this course doesn't end up squished into the end of the week.
