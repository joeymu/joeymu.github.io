    <h1>Technical Skills</h1>
    <p>
        My technical skillset is centered on data analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of tooling, I have extensive professional experience in Excel (ask my about its under-utilized functional programming features!), Google Sheets, Snowflake, Tableau, and PowerBI.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of programming, I have experience with Python (incl. numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, notebooks), SQL (incl. window functions and CTEs), VBA, and JavaScript as well as academic experience with C++.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to professional experience in each of the languages above, see my <a href="project-blog.md">Project Blog</a> for info on an in-progress personal project using them as well.
